## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### Mathematical Foundation

**Cost Function (MSE):**
```
J(m,c) = √(1/n × Σ(y_i - (mx_i + c))²)
```

**Gradient Descent Update Rules:**
```
m = m - α × ∂J/∂m
c = c - α × ∂J/∂c
```

**Where:**
- `m`: slope parameter (weight)
- `c`: intercept parameter (bias)  
- `α`: learning rate (0.01)
- `n`: number of training examples (60)

### Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.01 (optimized for stable convergence)
- **Iterations**: 10,000 (ensures complete optimization)
- **Initialization**: m=0, c=0 (zero initialization)
